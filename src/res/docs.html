			Smart VA Help
		</h2>
		<p>
			This document is an instruction manual for using IHME Smart Verbal Autopsy application. This application is developed based on the paper published in Population Health Metrics in 2011. The use of this tool is to process verbal autopsy data collected via surveys in order to assign individual causes of death. This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This program is distributed as is, in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Requirement</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			There is no mandatory requirement for using this program. However, this software is computationally heavy and having at least 2 GB free RAM will enhance the execution.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>General description</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			The IHME RandomForest Verbal Autopsy cause of death assignment systems is designed to work best with population health metrics research consortium (PHMRC) VA surveys. However, with proper mapping, it can be applied to any VA survey. The program uses RandomForest classifier to assign individual causes of death. Detailed description of the method can be found in [1].
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Packages Required:</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Numpy (Enthought can be downloaded free for academic users at http://www.enthought.com/products/getepd.php)
		</p>
		<p>
			Milk (can be downloaded at pypi.python.org/pypi/milk/)
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Instruction</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			After opening the program, the following dialog box will appear. Note that depending on the version of your windows, the appearance might be slightly different.
		</p>
		<p>
			As denoted in the program, three steps has to be followed.
		</p>
		<p>
			1- Selecting the Age module
		</p>
		<p>
			As the VA surveys for different age modules are different, user has to determine which age module has been used for the study. PHMRC study contained 3 age modules (Adult, Child, and Neonate). For specific definition of these age groups and their associated surveys, see [2].
		</p>
		<p>
			In addition to the age module, user should determine whether as part of the survey, questions regarding the healthcare experience (HCE) of the deceased or his/her family is asked. If HCE variables are not included in the study, then the software will use appropriate training data which is not enhanced with HCE variables. For detailed description of effect of HCE variables on estimations, see [1].
		</p>
		<p>
			2- Selecting input files
		</p>
		<p>
			Two input files are required for proper execution of the application.
		</p>
		<p>
			Data input file
		</p>
		<p>
			This comma delimited file should contain the result of the survey. Other than the first row which included the header of the columns, each row contains information about one death. Each death has to have one id, (denoted as "sid" in the header). The rest of the columns should represent symptoms associated with each death. The order of the columns is not important; however, their header should exactly match what is defined in available symptoms file. Note that all symptoms should be dichotomized. For yes/no questions, this simply is translated to 1/0 state. For questions with numerical or categorical response, please refer to IHME's guide for dichotomizing variables.
		</p>
		<p>
			Available symptom file This file provides a mean for the user to determine which symptoms are included in their verbal autopsy study. If you use PHMRC survey, you should have all the symptoms available. However, for those studies that use other surveys (such as WHO module) symptoms can be mapped to PHMRC symptoms. To do so, you should construct a comma delimited file, in which the first row represent the PHMRC symptom names and the second row consist of associated symptoms.
		</p>
		<p>
			We have included three sample files with this software package, each containing the symptoms for an age module. For example, the sample adult available symptoms file in the following denotes that in the user's data file, "sex" variable is represented as "gender". I addition it is noted that the symptom "s2" in PHMRC survey is mapped to symptom "s18" in user's data. Similarly for "s6", "s7 and "s11" the user's data has different headings. "s1", "s5", "s8", "s10", "s12", and "s13" of PHMRC data have the same title in his/her data file. Finally 0 means that the symptom is not included in the data. In the example, user has denoted that "s3" and "s4" symptom don't exist in his/her study.
		</p>
		<p>
			The user can change the appropriate age module available symptom files to perform the mapping. If you are using the PHMRC survey and you have all the symptoms available, simply the first and second lines should exactly be the same.
		</p>
		<p>
			After creating or proper editing of such file, the user has to select it.
		</p>
		<p>
			When both files are selected, the user can start the process by pushing the "Start!" button.
		</p>
		<p>
			After finishing the process, the program save the output in a file named "results X.csv" where X is the time when data is saved to the disc. A sample result file is presented below:
		</p>
		<p>
			As denoted, each row contains information about one death, including its unique id ("sid"), a list of numbers representing score of each cause of death for the individual, and the estimated cause of death (presented by a number). Note that the smaller the number in "columns "cause1" ... "cause 11" is, the more likely it is a cause of death. The estimated cause of death is simply the cause with smallest number. Note that the example here is for Neonate module, and therefore scores are shown for 11 causes. For Child and Adult modules, the generated file will have 21 and 46 cause respectively.
		</p>
		<p>
			While the program is running, it updates the user by printing update messages both in a console and on the user interface. Note that since this is a computationally heavy process, it may take between minute to hours to complete the processing, depending on the size of the data files and your computer specifications. An effective measure to speed up the process is to save the software and its file on the local disc. Running it from portable memories can reduce the speed of reading information from the files.

			<b>Frequently Asked Questions</b>
		</p>
		<p>
			Q. What does "sX" means in the list of symptoms?
		</p>
		<p>
			Q. How the symptom headers are mapped to actual survey questions?
		</p>
		<p>
			A. To see the mapping, open the file, names symptomdescription.csv for the appropriate module.
		</p>
		<p>
			Q. What does "causeX" mean? Q. how the cause classes are mapped to causes?
		</p>
		<p>
			A. To see the mapping, look at the report generated by the program in the console. The cause labels and their respective cause name is printed after each execution. For the reference, here is the completed reference of causes in all age groups:
